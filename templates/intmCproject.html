    <h4>1. Bank Management System</h4>
      <p>Here is a project we developed as mini project in C bank management system during our first semester; it is complete and totally error-free. This project is focused on customer account services in bank, so it is named “Customer Account Bank Management System”.

        Here, you can create a new account, update information of an existing account, view and manage transactions, check the details of an existing account, remove existing account and view customers’ list.

        Overall, with this project, you can perform banking activities like in a REAL bank. Bank management mini project in C is a console application without graphics. It is compiled in Code::Blocks with gcc compiler.

        The source code for this project is around 600 lines, so I didn’t want to display the source code here. The source code is password protected (password is codewithc). You can directly download the source code plus application file from the link below..</p>

        <h4>2. Cyber Management System</h4>
          <p>
            This mini project in C Cyber Management System utilizes various features of C like Socket, Multithreading, and more. It can prove to be very useful for C languages learners who are beginners in the programming field. File handling has been used as database to store records.

Understanding this project will help you create management software or your own mini projects like employee record, bank management, library management, etc. The whole project is divided into two programs, one for the client and one for the server.

There are two different source codes in this mini project on Cyber Management System in C: one for the client functions and other for the server functions. See a client-server example for socket programming in C.

The server program is for managing settings and client requests. The client program gives clients access to the cyber services. Both these source codes are short, each around 100 lines. You can directly download the source codes plus the executable files from the link below.

            <h4>3. Pacman Game</h4>
              <p>Pacman Game in C is a simple console application or a mini clip game designed for the purpose of entertainment. It resembles the snake game to some extent in which the Pacman should be driven in such a way that it moves along the predefined blue path so that the path is erased or eaten by Pacman. More you erase the path, more score you gain; the game is easy to play. Here, I have presented the source code and output screens for this project.

                The source code of the Pacman Game in C has been written in C programming language and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in which the project was developed is Code::Blocks using GCC compiler. You can download the source code, application files plus other files for this project from the link below.</p>
