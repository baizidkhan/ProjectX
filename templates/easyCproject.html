    <h4>1. Cricket Score Sheet</h4>
      <p>Cricket Score Sheet project is a simple project built using the C programming language. It uses file handling to store various information regarding runs, wickets, overs, extras, and many more. The program can display runs, wickets, names of batsmen and bowlers, overs, extras, economy of bowler, strike rate of batsmen, etc. It also displays the date and time of the game. The source code is complete, error-free and easy to understand.

        The source code of this cricket score sheet project needs to be compiled in Code::Blocks IDE using GCC compiler. You can directly download the source code, application file, and other program files of this project from the link below.</p>

Here I have presented a Typing Tutor Project in C to measure user’s typing speed and to enhance their typing speed. This is a simple console application written in C programming language, and compiled using GNU GCC compiler on Code::Blocks IDE.

                The source code of Typing Tutor Project in C consists of over 600 lines of code which are made user friendly by attaching comments to describe the function of each command. The project source code effectively utilizes the user defined functions and the concept of file handling. You can directly download the application file and source code of this project from the link below.</p>
